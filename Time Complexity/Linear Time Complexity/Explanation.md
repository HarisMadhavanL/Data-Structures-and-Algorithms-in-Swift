## Explanation:
* **Array Iteration:** You iterate through the ```numbers``` array, and for each ```number```, you check if it's divisible by 2 (```number % 2 == 0```).
* **Adding Even Numbers:** For each ```even number```, you append it to the evenNumbers array.
* **Counting Even Numbers:** Finally, you print the count of even numbers.

### Output:
For the array ```[2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10]```, the output will be:
```
4
```

This is a perfect example of O(n) time complexity, where the time taken grows linearly with the size of the array.
