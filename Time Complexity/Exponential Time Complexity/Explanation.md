## Explanation
### 1. Recursive Fibonacci:
* This function calculates the Fibonacci number by recursively summing up the two previous Fibonacci numbers.
* Time Complexity: **O(2âŒƒn)**, because each call branches into two more calls.

### 2. Iterative Fibonacci:
* This function iteratively calculates the Fibonacci number using two variables to store intermediate results.
* Time Complexity: **O(n)**, as it calculates each Fibonacci number in sequence only once.

## Performance Comparison
* For small ```n```, both methods perform adequately.
* For larger ```n```, the recursive method becomes significantly slower due to its exponential growth in calls.
* The iterative method remains efficient and handles much larger ```n``` without issues.

## Output:
For ```n=10``` and ```n=30```:
