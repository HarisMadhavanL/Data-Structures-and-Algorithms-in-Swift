## Explanation:
### 1. Accessing the middle element of the array:
* ```array[middleIndex]``` retrieves the element at a specific index, and this operation is O(1) regardless of the array's size.
* Result: ```"The middle element of array is 15"```

### 2. Accessing the value for a key in the dictionary:
* ```dictionary["b"]``` retrieves the value associated with the key "b". Dictionary lookups by key are O(1).
* Result: ```"The value of key b is 2"```

Both operations are efficient and independent of the size of the input.
